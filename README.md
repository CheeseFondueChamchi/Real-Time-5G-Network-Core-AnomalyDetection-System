1.Project Concept 
On 5G Network Core, the core system consists of a lot of subsystems as the size for the service is big.
So, Many Server are working to provide massive communication service.
To Find Out Root Causes from Service Fault, operator spends a lot time since the system faults alram given by vendor is not the perfect solution.
This project suggest the solution watching every single time series pattern generated Between the server connection or protocals


2.System Structure
Train function works to build single model for single statistical feature. it means 

2.1 train
-- sh script

2.2 inference
-- uvicorn 
-- sh script

3. Model 
-Anomaly Detection
-LSTM_AE
-TSNET
-DCDECTOR

4. Threeshold for Detection
- different threshold 

5. Result
