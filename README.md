1. 5G Network Core Anomaly Detection System.
  
  This project aims to build a resource-efficient anomaly detection system for 5G network core systems. 
  The architecture monitors statistical time-series data generated between network functions's (NFs) protocol layers to identify anomalies, offering robust detection capabilities while optimizing hardware resource usage.

  - Project Concept 
    Modern 5G network consist of a vast number of subsystems to provide massive communication serives. 
    Fault detection in these system is often complicated due to the volume and complexivity of statistical patterns generated between servers ans protocals.
    In personal opinion, to find out root causes from service fault, netwrok operator spends a lot time since the system faults alram given by vendor is not the perfect solution.
    
    This project introduces an anomaly detection solution
    that:
      - Monitors time-series patterns at various points of the system.
      - Applies advanced machine learning models to detect anomalies.
      - Minimizes hardware overhead by utilizing model quaintization and asynchronous inference methods.

  - System Architecture
    The system architecture for anomaly detection spans across multiple NFs within the 5G core systems
    Each NF anomaly detection module monitors statistical values generated by protocol layers as time-series pattern.
    
    The idea about detecting anomaly with sigle statistic pattern is given through the paper "Anomaly Transformer: Time Series Anomaly Detection with Association Discrepancy" 
    
    Therefore, Train/inference function implement to build single model for single statistical feature.

2. Key Modules
   
  2.1 Train Module
    The training modules uses AnomalyTransformer as the primary model for anomaly detection. it is periodically fine-tuned to adapt to random changes in time-series patterns caused by:
      - Netwrok function package updates.
      - Port flow connection changes between netwrok function objects.
    Highilghts
      - Performance : The AnomalyTransformer outperforms traditional models(e.g., LSTM-AE) in handling diverse time-series patterns without extensive hyperparameter tuning.
      - Model Quantization: To optimize resource use, the 64bit model is quatized to an 8bit model, reducing hardware requirements. Although this increase variance in anomaly scores by ~3%, it is deemed acceptable for production environments. 
      
  2.2 Inference Module
    Statistical values from differenct network functions are generated asynchronously, causing potential delays in anomaly detection. To minimize latency, the inference module leverages FastAPI with uvicorn library for asynchronous processing, ensuring real-time detection.

      - LSTM-AE (Bi-directional)
        Capture sequential dependencies in data by leveraging bidirectional LSTM architecture. 
        Effective for learing complex temporal patterns but requires more training time.

3. Threeshold for Detection
  A self-thresholding function is designed for each statistcal feature to enhance anomaly detection accuracy.
  The threshold values are determined during the final training steps based on probability density function.
  This approach adapt:
    -Feature-specific anomaly probabilities are accurately reflected.
    -Operator feedback is incorporated into the threshold definitions for tailored detection.
